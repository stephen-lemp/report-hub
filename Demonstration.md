✅ just highlights a big thing!

- What it is: a way to organize and publish all your reports in NetSuite.
- Why it's special:
  - ✅ Utilizes full SuiteCloud processing power to run large reports super fast
  - Supports filtering at header level as you would expect

  - Allows publishing ad-hoc SuiteQL queries for easy wins

## Basic Modes (stand-alone pages)

- List Reports
  - Lists > Search > Report Hub
  - Provides list of all reports
  - Great visualization of all reports in hierarchical structure
  - Limit access to reports so certain roles see only certain reports
  - Search reports and see results instantaneously 
- Run Report
  - Specify a report ID and the page will run the report
  - Utilize full SuiteCloud processing power to run large reports super fast.
  - OR check the "Quick Run" checkbox to run a query or search without initiating a background thread
    - When you're running smaller reports or saved searches, this could be a little faster
  - Utilize header filters to quickly filter your data
  - Export results as CSV using the "Download CSV" button


## Dashboard Use

- This is where the magic happens!
- The package comes with a portlet that can be deployed as many times as needed. 
- Deploy the portlet without a config selected to display full listing of all reports available to the user's role
  - ✅ This listing allows quick CSV download of multiple reports all at once!
- Deploy the portlet with a config selected to run the report directly on your dashboard
